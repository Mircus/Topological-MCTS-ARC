Instead of just exploring possible moves, the agent analyzes the underlying mathematical \"shape\" of the game's decision space to make smarter, more strategic choices.\n","\n","Core Concepts\n","Game as a Topological Space: The agent doesn't see the puzzle as just a grid. It represents the entire game, including all possible states and moves, as a high-dimensional mathematical object called a simplicial complex.\n","\n","0-simplices are individual game states (the grid configuration).\n","\n","1-simplices are moves connecting two states (an edge in the game graph).\n","\n","2-simplices (triangles) and higher represent more complex strategic relationships between multiple states.\n","\n","Spectral Guidance in MCTS: The agent analyzes the spectrum (eigenvalues and eigenvectors) of the game's graph Laplacian. This analysis reveals strategically important states.\n","\n","Spectral Centrality: Identifies \"bottleneck\" or critical-path states in the game.\n","\n","Diffusion Flow: Measures how information or influence spreads through the game space.\n","\n","This topological data is used to create a topological bonus, guiding the MCTS algorithm to explore more promising areas of the search space.\n","\n","Topological Transfer Learning: The most advanced feature is its ability to learn from past experiences.\n","\n","For each puzzle, the agent calculates a unique topological signature (a set of invariants like Betti numbers, branching factor, etc.).\n","\n","When faced with a new puzzle, it compares its signature to a database of previously solved puzzles.\n","\n","If it finds a puzzle with a similar topological structure (a \"spectral morphism\"), it transfers the successful strategy, even if the puzzles look different on the surface (e.g., a horizontal line and a vertical line puzzle may be topologically equivalent).\n","\n","How It Works: The Workflow\n","Parse and Build: The agent takes an initial and a target grid and builds a graph of all reachable game states.\n","\n","Topological Analysis: It constructs a SimplicialComplex from this game graph and computes its spectral features (centrality, diffusion flow).\n","\n","Extract Invariants: It calculates the game's unique topological fingerprint.\n","\n","Find Similar Games: It queries its database for games with a similar topological fingerprint to enable transfer learning.\n","\n","Guided Search: The TopologicalMCTSEngine runs a search for the best move. The search is guided not just by winning, but by moving toward states with high topological importance (the spectral bonus) and by using policies transferred from similar games.\n","\n","Learn and Store: After finding a solution, the agent stores the game, its solution, and its topological analysis in its database for future use.\n","\n","Key Classes\n","TopologicalMetaAgent: The main orchestrator that manages learning, transfer, and the overall process.\n","\n","ARCGame: Defines the rules and state space of a specific pattern puzzle.\n","\n","SimplicialComplex: The core of the topological analysis, responsible for building the complex and calculating spectral features.\n","\n","TopologicalMCTSEngine: A modified MCTS algorithm that uses the topological data to enhance its selection, expansion, and simulation steps.\n","\n","********************************\n","\n","\n","The Scenario: A Strategic Fork\n","Imagine the agent is at a game state S₀, where it has already placed one red dot. The goal is to complete a vertical line.\n","\n","Current State (S₀):\n","\n","[1, 0, 0]\n","[0, 0, 0]\n","[0, 0, 0]\n","From S₀, the agent considers its next move. Let's look at three of the many possibilities:\n","\n","Move A (Good Move): Place a dot at (1, 0). This continues the intended vertical pattern.\n","\n","Resulting State (Sₐ):\n","\n","[1, 0, 0]\n","[1, 0, 0]\n","[0, 0, 0]\n","Move B (Pivoting Move): Place a dot at (0, 1). This abandons the vertical pattern to start a horizontal one.\n","\n","Resulting State (Sᵦ):\n","\n","[1, 1, 0]\n","[0, 0, 0]\n","[0, 0, 0]\n","Move C (Distant Move): Place a dot far away at (2, 2). This move seems unrelated to the first dot.\n","\n","Resulting State (Sᵧ):\n","\n","[1, 0, 0]\n","[0, 0, 0]\n","[0, 0, 1]\n","Forming the 2-Simplex (Triangle)\n","The AI doesn't just see three separate options. The code's _add_strategic_triangles method identifies that Sₐ, Sᵦ, and Sᵧ all originate from the same parent state, S₀. It groups these three potential outcomes into a single structure: a 2-simplex.\n","\n","The vertices of this triangle are the three outcome states: {Sₐ, Sᵦ, Sᵧ}.\n","\n","The triangle itself represents the strategic relationship between these choices.\n","\n","What this tells the agent:\n","\n","This isn't just any choice; it's a crucial decision point. By creating this triangle, the agent explicitly recognizes that the move it makes from S₀ will send the game in one of three very different directions.\n","\n","The code even calculates the strategic_diversity of this triangle by measuring how different the grids of Sₐ, Sᵦ, and Sᵧ are from each other. A triangle with high diversity, like this one, signals to the MCTS that it should pay extra attention to this decision, as the consequences of the choice are significant.\n","\n","**********************************************************************\n","How Weights Are Assigned\n","The code assigns these importance scores in a few key ways:\n","\n","For 2-Simplices (Triangles): When the agent identifies a choice point that leads to three different outcomes, it forms a 2-simplex and assigns it a strategic_value. This value is calculated based on _compute_strategic_diversity, meaning a triangle connecting three very different game states gets a higher score, flagging it as a critical decision.\n","\n","For Higher-Order Simplices: The agent groups states with similar patterns into higher-dimensional simplices. These are weighted by _compute_pattern_coherence, which measures how consistent the group is. A high score indicates a strong, recurring pattern or motif.\n","\n","For 0-Simplices (States): Individual game states (vertices) are also weighted using spectral analysis. Each state gets a spectral_centrality and a diffusion_flow score, which measure how critical that state is to the overall structure of the game.\n","\n","How Weights Are Used\n","These weights create a \"strategic map\" that guides the Monte Carlo Tree Search. The TopologicalMCTSEngine uses these scores to make smarter decisions:\n","\n","Selection: When choosing which path to explore, the agent adds a topological_bonus (derived from spectral centrality and diffusion flow) to the standard UCB calculation. This pushes the search toward more strategically important areas of the game.\n","\n","Expansion & Simulation: The agent also uses these topological scores to prioritize which new moves to try and to guide its simulated rollouts, making its exploration less random and more focused.\n","\n","*******************************************\n","\n","the automorphisms of the simplicial complex would be highly relevant and represent a more advanced form of topological analysis.\n","\n","While the provided code doesn't compute them explicitly, the concept is a natural extension of its core ideas.\n","\n","What Automorphisms Represent\n","An automorphism of the game's simplicial complex would be a symmetry of the entire game space. It's a transformation that maps the complex onto itself while preserving all its strategic relationships—which states connect to which, and which moves form strategic triangles, etc.\n","\n","In simpler terms, it would identify parts of the game that are strategically identical. For example, in tic-tac-toe, a move in the top-left corner is strategically equivalent to a move in the top-right corner (via a reflection). An automorphism would mathematically capture this equivalence.\n","\n","Potential Benefits\n","If the agent could compute these automorphisms, it would lead to powerful advantages:\n","\n","Massive Search Space Pruning: The agent would understand that it doesn't need to explore every possible move sequence. If it has analyzed one sequence, it automatically understands the outcome of all \"symmetric\" variations of that sequence. It would only need to explore one representative from each symmetry class, drastically improving efficiency.\n","\n","Guaranteed Strategy Transfer: This is a much stronger concept than the similarity-based transfer learning in the code. If state S' is an automorphism of state S, then a good strategy from S can be transformed into a provably good strategy from S'.\n","\n","How It Relates to the Current Code\n","The current script touches upon this concept without fully implementing it:\n","\n","The _compute_symmetry_score function calculates the visual symmetry of the target grid (e.g., if it can be flipped horizontally). This is a very simple heuristic related to the symmetry of the goal, not the entire game dynamic.\n","\n","The agent's search for \"topologically similar games\" is an attempt to find structure-preserving maps (isomorphisms) between different games. An automorphism is a special case of this, where the map is from a game back to itself.\n","\n","*******************************************************\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"VbP2Vz07uHLL"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# ============================================================================\n","# Topological Monte Carlo Tree Search for ARC-style Pattern Completion Games\n","# A Universal Learning Agent with Deep Topological Integration\n","# ============================================================================\n","\n","# ============================================================================\n","# Required Imports\n","# ============================================================================\n","\n","import numpy as np\n","import scipy\n","from scipy import linalg\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Set, Optional, Union, Any\n","from dataclasses import dataclass\n","from collections import defaultdict\n","import itertools\n","from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n","import random\n","import math\n","import warnings\n","import sys\n","import time\n","\n","# Suppress numerical warnings for cleaner output\n","warnings.filterwarnings('ignore', category=RuntimeWarning)\n","warnings.filterwarnings('ignore', category=FutureWarning)\n","# Suppress linalg warnings if available\n","try:\n","    warnings.filterwarnings('ignore', category=np.linalg.LinAlgWarning)\n","except AttributeError:\n","    pass  #
